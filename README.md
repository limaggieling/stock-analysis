# stock-analysis
 using vba, create macros to automate stock analysis data

## Overview of Project

**Purpose**
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize VBA to code a macro that would automate the process of analyzing different stocks chosen by Steve's parents. Initially, we only analyzed the DQ stock by reading the 2017 and 2018 sheets to extract the closing prices at the start of the year compared to the end of the year. Also, we wanted to find the total volume traded which we assume to be an indicator of the success of the stock. Then, we wanted to apply the same analysis on all of the stocks. Lastly, we wanted to refine our code to run efficiently.   

**Background**
Coding through VBA allows us to create macros that can automate trivial, repetitive tasks in Microsoft Office Excel. By creating macros, we can efficiently screen through data and output information that we can use to make inferences. For example, we can run a quick analysis that will spit out the percent return and total volume in less than one fifth of a second. 

**Results** 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

**Summary**
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
